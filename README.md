## Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm (Pygame)

- **Easy** - Random AI moves  
- **Medium** - AI uses Minimax but with limited depth  
- **Hard** - AI plays perfectly using full Minimax  

You can **click on the board** to make a move. The game will announce a **winner or a draw**, and you can click anywhere to restart.
